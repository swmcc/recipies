![I is chef](http://f.cl.ly/items/0v2P3B45423J1H2l2W1T/chef.jpg "I is chef")

## Why?

I want a place to keep my recipies. Instead of having them bookmarked or in a text file I want to keep them on here. I pay github 12 US Dollah a month (at the time of writing) so I don't mind doing this in here ;) Plus it is good shit, you should try some - fork the recipies and give me improvements ;)

The layout isn't very good at the minute but that might change given time.
