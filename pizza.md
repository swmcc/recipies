# Pizza

This recipe is from [Michele Hughes](https://twitter.com/ManyHues).

## Ingredients

### Pizza dough
1 packet of easy bake dried yeast
1 tsp honey
160ml of tepid water
125g strong bread flour
125g plain flour
1 level tsp salt

### Tomato sauce
1 clove of crushed garlic
2 tbsp of tomato puree
70-100mls passata (depending on how much sauce you like on pizzas)
½ tsp honey
½ tsp dried italian herbs
Ground black pepper to taste

### Additional Ingredients
About 2Tbsp Olive oil
Extra flour for kneading

### Toppings
125g mature cheddar cheese, grated
Half a ball of mozzarella, sliced
2 slices of deli-style ham

## Directions

Dissolve the yeast and honey in the tepid water, stir well, and leave to sit for about 5 minutes.
In a large bowl, mix the two flours together with the salt. Make a well in the centre and pour in the yeast mixture.  

With a fork, slowly bring together the flour and yeast mixture to make a moist dough.  Add an extra teaspoon of tepid water if you have stubborn bits of flour that won’t incorporate.
Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface (I use a silicone pastry mat). Flour both your hands and knead the dough (roll, push and fold the dough over) for five minutes until it feels elastic.

Pour about a teaspoon of olive oil into the mixing bowl and smear it around the bowl with a piece of kitchen roll. Make the dough into a round shape and place it back into the oiled mixing bowl.  
Score the dough deeply with a sharp knife, which allows it to relax as it proves.  Cover the bowl with cling film and leave (preferably somewhere warm) to prove. This should take an hour.
When the dough has doubled in size, give it another quick knead for a couple of minutes.  Make it into a round shape and roll it out into a rough circle-shape of about 12 inches. 
I use a metal pizza tray and I roll my pizza dough just large enough to create a raised edge when I lay it in the pizza tray (the raised edge mean no sauce leaks during cooking). 

Lay the pizza dough onto the pizza tray and brush about 1-1.5 tablespoons of olive oil over the surface of the dough. Add the pizza sauce and swirl it over the oiled pizza base.
Sprinkle 3/4s of the cheddar cheese over the base; add roughly torn strips of ham;  dot with slices of mozzarella, and then sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese over the pizza.

Cook for 10-15 minutes (at 225C fan oven or 250C normal oven). When cooked, leave to sit and cool for 5 minutes before slicing. 

## Notes
This recipe makes a pizza dough that falls somewhere between thin crust and deep pan pizza base. If you want thin crust - use all strong bread flour in the recipe. If you want deep pan - use all plain flour in the recipe.
